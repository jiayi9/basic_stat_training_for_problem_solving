*Plan B*

Focus on Hypothesis test

Yes or No -> Probability


normal distribution
minitab: 

 - Probability distribution plot (theoretical)
 - Histogram with fit, try different distribution (practical)

 - Truth and data
 - mu = 8, xbar = 9
 - Type 1 error, type 2 error
 - Assumption
 - When assumption can be dropped
 - The mu or others
 - For variances, F test
 
 - When mu and variances are both different
 
 - A special case, you need to paired things up, paired t-test
 - Normality test
 
 
 - ANOVA
 








Plan A

With Minitab

1. Clearly define your problem and population

Speedweek ?

Leakage ?





2. Conduct DOE or collect data

Database




3. Always visualize your data first


4. You need to clean your data and justify clearly why

Identify outliers, whether delete it


5. Choose the correct hypothesis test or model




6. Make a sense-making conclusion
